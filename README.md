This project contains the resolutions of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenges, an initiative by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fjavascript30.com%2F&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Ebuttonembed%7Ctwterm%5Efollow%7Ctwgr%5Ewesbos&region=follow_link&screen_name=wesbos) to encourage people to learn things and build projects using JavaScript Vanilla for free.

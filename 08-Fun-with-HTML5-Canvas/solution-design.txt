This will be a very challenging one, since I know almost nothing
about HTML canvas. That being sad, probably I'll watch the challenge video
and try to learn from it, instead of creating a solution myself and then
comparing to the official resolution of the challenge.

Therefore, here is how I would structure what needs to be done to build
an interactive canvas:

# Select the canvas element in JS
# A flag to detect whenever the user is wanting to draw or nothing
# Get the canvas context and resize it the same size as the window
# Use context properties for drawing:
  # strokeStyle = indicates the color, gradient, pattern used for the outlines of shapes
  # lineJoin = determines how two line segments will look like when they meet
  # lineCap = indicates the shape with which the end of lines will be drawn
# Keep track on where the mouse last stopped (lastOffsetX and lastOffsetY location)
